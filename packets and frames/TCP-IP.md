### TCP/IP (The Three-Way Handshake)

**TCP** (or **T**ransmission **C**ontrol **P**rotocol for short) is another one of these rules used in networking.

This protocol is very similar to the OSI model that we have previously discussed in room three of this module so far. The TCP/IP protocol consists of four layers and is arguably just a summarised version of the OSI model. These layers are:

-   Application
-   Transport
-   Internet
-   Network Interface

- information is added to each layer of the TCP model as the piece of data (or packet) traverses it -- _**encapsulation**_
- defining feature is _**connection-based**_: TCP must establish a connection between both a client and a device acting as a server **before** data is sent
- guarantees data received on the other end -- known as the Three-way handshake

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Advantages of TCP** | **Disadvantages of TCP** |
| Guarantees the integrity of data. | Requires a reliable connection between the two devices. If one small chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be used and must be re-sent. |
| Capable of synchronising two devices to prevent each other from being flooded with data in the wrong order. | A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the other device the whole time. |
| Performs a lot more processes for reliability | TCP is significantly slower than UDP because more work (computing) has to be done by the devices using this protocol. |

- TCP packets contain _**headers**_ -> added from encapsulation

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Header | Description |
| Source Port | This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time). |
| Destination Port | This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random. |
| Source IP | This is the IP address of the device that is sending the packet. |
| Destination IP | This is the IP address of the device that the packet is destined for. |
| **Sequence Number** | When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is given a random number. We'll explain this more in-depth further on. |
| Acknowledgement Number | After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number for the next piece of data will have the sequence number + 1. We'll also explain this more in-depth further on. |
| Checksum | This value is what gives TCP integrity. A mathematical calculation is made where the output is remembered. When the receiving device performs the mathematical calculation, the data must be corrupt if the output is different from what was sent. |
| Data | This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored. |
| Flag | This header determines how the packet should be handled by either device during the handshake process. Specific flags will determine specific behaviours, which is what we'll come on to explain below. |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step** | **Message** | **Description** |
| 1   | SYN | A SYN message is the initial packet sent by a client during the handshake. This packet is used to initiate a connection and synchronise the two devices together (we'll explain this further later on). |
| 2   | SYN/ACK | This packet is sent by the receiving device (server) to acknowledge the synchronisation attempt from the client. |
| 3   | ACK | The acknowledgement packet can be used by either the client or server to acknowledge that a series of messages/packets have been successfully received. |
| 4   | DATA | Once a connection has been established, data (such as bytes of a file) is sent via the "DATA" message. |
| 5   | FIN | This packet is used to _cleanly (properly)_ close the connection after it has been complete. |
| #   | RST | This packet abruptly ends all communication. This is the last resort and indicates there was some problem during the process. For example, if the service or application is not working correctly, or the system has faults such as low resources. |

Any sent data is given a random number sequence and is reconstructed using this number sequence and incrementing by 1. Both computers must agree on the same number sequence for data to be sent in the correct order. This order is agreed upon during three steps:

1.  SYN - Client: Here's my Initial Sequence Number(ISN) to SYNchronise with (0)
2.  SYN/ACK - Server: Here's my Initial Sequence Number (ISN) to SYNchronise with (5,000), and I ACKnowledge your initial number sequence (0)
3.  ACK - Client: I ACKnowledge your Initial Sequence Number (ISN) of (5,000), here is some data that is my ISN+1 (0 + 1)

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device | **Initial Number Sequence (ISN)  <br>** | **Final Number Sequence  <br>** |
| Client (Sender) | 0   | 0 + 1 = 1 |
| Client (Sender) | 1   | 1 + 1 = 2 |
| Client (Sender) | 2   | 2 + 1 = 3 |

- TCP closes connection once it's determined other device has successfully received the data
- TCP consumes resources on device, so best to close connection as soon as possible

### UDP/IP


**U**ser **D**atagram **P**rotocol (**UDP**) is another protocol that is used to communicate data between devices

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Advantages of UDP** | **Disadvantages of UDP** |
| UDP is much faster than TCP. | UDP doesn't care if the data is received or not. |
| UDP leaves the application (user software) to decide if there is any control over how quickly packets are sent. | It is quite flexible to software developers in this sense. |
| UDP does not reserve a continuous connection on a device as TCP does. | This means that unstable connections result in a terrible experience for the user. |

- no safeguards for data integrity like TCP
- UDP packets are much simpler than TCP packets and have fewer headers. However, both protocols share some standard headers, which are what is annotated in the table below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Header** | **Description** |
| Time to Live (TTL) | This field sets an expiry timer for the packet, so it doesn't clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape! |
| Source Address | The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from, so that data knows where to return to. |
| Destination Address | The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next. |
| Source Port | This value is the port that is opened by the sender to send the UDP packet from. This value is randomly chosen (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time). |
| Destination Port | This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving the data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random. |
| Data | This header is where data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored. |

- UDP is **stateless**: no acknowledgement is sent during connection

### Ports 101 (Practical)

- ports are essential point which data can be exchanged
- ships and **ports**
- Networking devices also use ports to enforce strict rules when communicating with one another
- numerical between **0 and 65535**
- all web browsers now share one common rule: data is sent over port 80

| **Protocol** | **Port Number** | **Description** |
| **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol (**FTP**) | 21  | This protocol is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location. |
| **S**ecure **Sh**ell (**SSH**) | 22  | This protocol is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management. |
| **H**yper**T**ext Transfer Protocol (**HTTP**) | 80  | This protocol powers the World Wide Web (WWW)! Your browser uses this to download text, images and videos of web pages. |
| **H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol **S**ecure (**HTTPS**) | 443 | This protocol does the exact same as above; however, securely using encryption. |
| **S**erver **M**essage **B**lock (**SMB**) | 445 | This protocol is similar to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); however, as well as files, SMB allows you to share devices like printers. |
| **R**emote **D**esktop **P**rotocol (**RDP**) | 3389 | This protocol is a secure means of logging in to a system using a visual desktop interface (as opposed to the text-based limitations of the SSH protocol). |
