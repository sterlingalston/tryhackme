- High Pay - jobs in security have high starting salaries

- Exciting - work can include legally hacking systems or defending against cyber attacks

- Be in demand - there are over 3.5 million unfilled cyber positions

- **Security engineers** develop and implement security solutions using 
  threats and vulnerability data - often sourced from members of the 
  security workforce. Security engineers work across circumventing a 
  breadth of attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, 
  and evolving trends and tactics.
  
  - - Testing and screening security measures across software
    - Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
    - Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

- **Incident responders** respond productively and efficiently to security 
  breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and 
  protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents. 
  This is often a highly pressurised position with assessments and 
  responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident 
  response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from attacks.) The 
  aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial 
  standing and avoid negative breach implications. Ultimately, incident 
  responders protect the company's data, reputation, and financial 
  standing from cyber attacks.
  
  - metrics include: MTTD = mean time to detect, MTTA = mean time to acknowledge, MTTR = mean time to response 
  
  - Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
  
  - Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
  
  - Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

- **Digital Forensics Examiner** working as part of a law-enforcement department, you would be focused on
   collecting and analysing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the 
  guilty and exonerating the innocent. On the other hand, if your work 
  falls under defending a company's network, you will be using your 
  forensic skills to analyse incidents, such as policy violations.
  
  - - Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
    - Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
    - Document your findings and report on the case

- **Malware Analyst**
  
  - - Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
    - Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
    - Document and report all the findings

    

- **Penetration Tester**
  
  - - Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
    - Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
    - Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

- **Red Teamer**
  
  - - Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
    - Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
    - Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
